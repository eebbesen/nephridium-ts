# nephridium-ts

This is an experimental app to help users build URLs for https://github.com/eebbesen/nephridium.

Functionality is incomplete but it still may be of use for generating the Nephridium URL params.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
